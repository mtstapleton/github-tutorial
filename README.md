#### *Identifying the Drivers of Wildfires in BC and the Analysis and Comparison of Regional Wildfire Threat Scores*



This project will compare two wildfire threat models - PSTA and BurnP3+. It will look at the inputs for each model, how do they compare and how to they influence the resulting threat score for a region on BC. I will be looking at 7 communities in Northeastern BC to complete the comparison and resulting analysis, on both a community level and regional level. Visual comparisons will be the main component with some basic statistical analysis to back up the visual observations.
